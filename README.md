## About
- The official Python implementation of the **CycPeptMP**
- **CycPeptMP** is an accurate and efficient method for predicting the membrane permeability of cyclic peptides.
- We designed features for cyclic peptides at the atom-, monomer-, and peptide-levels to concurrently capture both the local sequence variations and global conformational changes in cyclic peptides. We also applied data augmentation techniques at three scales to enhance model training efficiency.
